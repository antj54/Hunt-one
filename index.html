        <p class="text" id="main">As the sun rises and after a few hours of tracking, you find yourself 
            in a small clearing and realize you are no longer alone. Alarmed, you stand motionless and wait for this<br> stranger to make
            a move. After a moment of silence, you decide to move closer to <b>inspect</b> the figure further. Upon taking your first
            step the stranger vanishes, leaving you<br> to wonder if he really existed, or if it was just an illusion
            of a tired mind. After a moment of reflection, you press on with the Hunt.
